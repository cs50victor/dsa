"""
The term backtracking suggests that if the current solution is not suitable, then backtrack and try other solutions. Thus, recursion is used in this approach.

This approach is used to solve problems that have multiple solutions. If you want an optimal solution, you must go for dynamic programming.


Backtracking Algorithm Applications
1. To find all Hamiltonian Paths present in a graph.
2. To solve the N Queen problem.
3. Maze solving problem.
4. The Knight's tour problem.
