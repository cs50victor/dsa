> O(log N) basically means time goes up linearly as the n goes up exponentially. So if it takes 1 second to compute 10 elements, it will take 2 seconds to compute 100 elements, 3 seconds to compute 1000 elements, and so on.
> O(1) constant means it doesn't depend on the input. Stays the same regardless.
